# Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with TF-Agents
This repository contains a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
implementation with TensorFlow-Agents, configured for the 
[`MultiCarRacing-v0` Gym environment](https://github.com/igilitschenski/multi_car_racing).
To use this MARL framework, please see the sections below.

## Installation
To install all the necessary dependencies for this repository, you can do so either 
via `pip` or `conda`:

```
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rmsander/marl_ppo.git
cd marl_ppo

# Option A: Install requirements with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option B: Install requirements with conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Running the Environment
After installation, the environment can be tried out by running:
```
python3 envs/multi_car_racing.py
```

## Running the Trainer
To run the trainer, please first edit the parameters in `ppo/parameters.py`. 
Then, once ready, run:
```
python3 ppo/ppo_marl.py
```
